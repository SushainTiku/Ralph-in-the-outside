      Once upon a time, in a strange world, lived a boy named ralph. Ralph was your regular type of kid. But his environment, not so much. He and his family lived in a big red circle for absolutely no reason at all. If someone were to step out of the circle, they would get launched back and then be attacked by wild rabbits for once again, no reason. All of Ralph's 7 other siblings who lived with him didn't really care. 
But Ralph, on the other hand, wanted to explore the outside world. 
So one day instead of walking over the circle, he jumped. Somehow, it worked and he had reached the other side of the wall.”How could any of my older siblings not discover this in the last 8 years?” thought ralph. He looked back and saw a rope that no one could see on the other side. The rope just floated above the circle. When Ralph pulled it, the circle extended. 
“So this is what holds the circle!” Said ralph to himself. He jumped back over and went to his family.
”Oh, Ralph,dear boy, you’re just in time for the announcement!” Said his grandmother.
“Your father’s good friend’s mother’s cousin’s godfather’s aunt’s brother’s son is coming to visit!”. “Dad’s what?”whispered James, the oldest of the children to Ralph.”I think she means great uncle Jim.” Responded ralph.

    <p>“Jim’s here!” Said Ralph’s mother.Jim jumped down from a plane and landed at their door.”Hi there suzie!” Said Jim. “Jim! Please, come in!” Said Ralph’s mother.”Kids! Get down here!” All the children except Ralph, who was already down, Rushed down the stairs and all stood in a line from shortest to tallest. “There’s James, Mike, Susan, Mick, Launa, 	Jake, and Little Nick   
who just turned 2!” Said Suzie.
 “Boy, that sure is a lot of Kiddos!” Said Jim.After talking a while. Jim went outside. Ralph went with him so that he could show what he had Discovered. Ralph JUMPED OVER THE WALL. Jim  was amazed.
“Wowwy kiddo! You really cracked the secret of the circle!” Said Jim. “Thanks, Great Uncle Jim. But Ihave one question, How do YOU get over the wall?” Asked Ralph. “Using a plane is really the same thing as jumping over it. But I use a plane because what’s the fun in that?”.
 Jim really did like to have fun even at an old age. 
“Uncle, have you seen the rope?” Asked Ralph. “Oh, you mean the infinite rope?” Asked Jim. “what’s that?” Asked Ralph being very confused. “If you wish to learn more, come with me.” Ralph followed Jim to a tree and dug underneath. Ralph felt a cold piece of metal. He dug more, and lifted the object. “It’s a book!” Cried Ralph. Jim opened the book to reveal Pictures and writings and a lot of pages. “Ah, here it is.
If someone is surrounded by a red circle. They may go over it to escape. But however, the circle will follow you. The best way to expand the circle is to pull the infinite rope, a rope that does not start nor end. Another way to do this is to say this spell-”. Jim stopped midway. The paper read ‘Expelos expandos’. “Why did you stop?” Asked ralph
“Do not say those words!” Said Jim. “They require special training.Luckily I can teach you.” Said Jim. “Will you?” Asked Ralph. “Of course Kiddo!” Cried Jim.

      “Rise n’ shine, kiddo!” Cried Jim. Ralph rubbed his eyes. “Uncle Jim? What are you doing here? It's 6 in the morning!”Wisphered Ralph.”When training with magic, you can never sleep!”.Ralph brushed his teeth and got out of his pajamas.”Okay kiddo, with magic, you must be extremely careful! Now, close your eyes, think about any element, any!”. “Ralph closed his eyes and thought about air. Jim watched as Ralph started to hover. Ralph opened his eyes to see that he was hovering in the air. He slowly came back down. “Jolly, kiddo! You’re a natural!” Cried uncle Jim."I guess I really am!" Said Ralph looking at his hands. “Remember kiddo, never use your power for evil! There are a lot of em’ scumbags, but I'm sure you ain’t gonna be one of em’!” Said uncle Jim.
“Don't worry uncle, I can promise you I won’t do that.” Responded Ralph. Ralph looked at his hands again. He felt a strange aura. “Jim! Ralph! Dinners ready!” Screamed Ralph’s mom. Ralph ran inside and Jim followed. After dinner, Ralph went to bed early. He wanted to practise magic tomorrow 
early in the morning.
